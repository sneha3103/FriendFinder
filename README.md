# FriendFinder

# Overview
FriendFinder is a compatibility-based application, similar to a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
This application is built using Express to handle the routing and will be deployed through Heroku.
